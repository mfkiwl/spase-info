        "Description": "This data set contains calibrated level-2 images and spectra data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). \n\nUV images from IRIS telesccope record observations of features as small as 240 km (150 miles) on the sun every five to ten seconds at specific temperatures, ranging from 5,000 K and 65,000 K (and up to 10 million K during solar flares). This range is tailored to observe material traveling on the surface of the sun, called the photosphere, and in the lowermost layers of the atmosphere, called the chromosphere and transition region. \n\nSpectra are obtained every one to two seconds along a slit (1/3 arcsec wide) of solar material at temperatures from 5,000 K to 10 million K, providing information on exactly how much light is visible from any specific wavelength.  This corresponds to how much material is present at specific velociites, temperatures and densities. \n\nThe level-2 data is corrected for dark current, flat-field, and geometric deformation, scaled to the same plate-scale, and packaged into timeseries of slitjaw images and spectral raster scans. The calibration is preliminary and will improve in the coming months.",
