This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy                     
Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft               
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet              
Uranus.  The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to                     
1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series                 
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available            
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because                  
the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the                   
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,             
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.                    
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged              
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are              
time averaged over an arbitrary period (24 seconds)                          
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle                 
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384                
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called              
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is                   
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled                
during the scanning periods.                                                 
                                                                             
   Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this                  
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for                
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;               
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special               
Uranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,               
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute                  
period when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the               
word scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping                    
for a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data                 
the two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been               
averaged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records                  
of the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.              
As stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods                
of no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)                  
are for 24 sec periods.                                                      
                                                                             
     The schedule of mode changes is as follows:                             
                                                                             
     prior to day 24/0420:      Mode (1)                                     
                                                                             
     24/0420  to  25/ 1357:     Mode (2)                                     
                                                                             
     after day 25/1357:         Mode (1)                                     
                                                                             
Please note that the change-over between modes is not                        
instantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the                   
scanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief                     
interruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)                 
scan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the                       
movable block periods that bracketed the close approach                      
position (not shown above).                                                  
                                                                             
     Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             
switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data               
a disjointed appearance.

Please note that 3 of the electron channels are derived from                 
4 of the instrumental channels by taking differences between                 
adjacent (in energy) channels.                                               
                                                                             
     The channel data is given in units of intensity:                        
counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed                
that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                
the raw count rates via the relation:                                        
                                                                             
                    I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                    
                                                                             
where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                  
(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton               
values of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities             
for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption           
that some other mass species dominates, one must convert back                
to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then                 
convert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the               
mass species in question.  The parameters can be found in                    
Table 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                 
V. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons         
can be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                
V. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,             
the count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,                     
(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and             
(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.

This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy                     
Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft               
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet              
Uranus.  The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to                     
1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series                 
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available            
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because

and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.                    
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged

for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle                 
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384                
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called              
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is                   
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled                
during the scanning periods.                                                 
                                                                             
   Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this                  
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for                
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;               
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special               
Uranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,               
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute                  
period when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the               
word scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping                    
for a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data                 
the two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been               
averaged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records                  
of the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.              
As stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods                
of no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)                  
are for 24 sec periods.                                                      
                                                                             
     The schedule of mode changes is as follows:

Please note that the change-over between modes is not                        
instantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the                   
scanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief                     
interruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)                 
scan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the                       
movable block periods that bracketed the close approach

     Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             
switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data               
a disjointed appearance.

Please note that 3 of the electron channels are derived from                 
4 of the instrumental channels by taking differences between                 
adjacent (in energy) channels.                                               
                                                                             
     The channel data is given in units of intensity:                        
counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed                
that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                
the raw count rates via the relation:                                        
                                                                             
                    I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                    
                                                                             
where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                  
(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton               
values of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities             
for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption           
that some other mass species dominates, one must convert back                
to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then                 
convert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the               
mass species in question.  The parameters can be found in                    
Table 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                 
V. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons         
can be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                
V. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,             
the count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,                     
(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and             
(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.

Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft<br>
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet<br>
Uranus.  The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to<br>
1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series<br>
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available<br>
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because<br>
the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the<br>
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,<br>
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.<br>
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged<br>
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are<br>
time averaged over an arbitrary period (24 seconds)<br>
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle<br>
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384<br>
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called<br>
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is<br>
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled<br>
during the scanning periods.</p>
<p>Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this<br>
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for<br>
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;<br>
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special<br>
Uranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,<br>
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute<br>
period when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the<br>
word scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping<br>
for a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data<br>
the two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been<br>
averaged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records<br>
of the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.<br>
As stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods<br>
of no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)<br>
are for 24 sec periods.</p>
<pre><code> The schedule of mode changes is as follows:                             
                                                                         
 prior to day 24/0420:      Mode (1)                                     
                                                                         
 24/0420  to  25/ 1357:     Mode (2)                                     
                                                                         
 after day 25/1357:         Mode (1)                                     
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the change-over between modes is not<br>
instantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the<br>
scanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief<br>
interruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)<br>
scan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the<br>
movable block periods that bracketed the close approach<br>
position (not shown above).</p>
<pre><code> Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             
</code></pre>
<p>switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data<br>
a disjointed appearance.</p>

<p>Please note that the change-over between modes is not<br>
instantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the<br>
scanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief<br>
interruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)<br>
scan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the<br>
movable block periods that bracketed the close approach<br>
position (not shown above).</p>
<pre><code> Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             
</code></pre>
<p>switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data<br>
a disjointed appearance.</p>

<p>Please note that 3 of the electron channels are derived from<br>
4 of the instrumental channels by taking differences between<br>
adjacent (in energy) channels.</p>
<pre><code> The channel data is given in units of intensity:                        
</code></pre>
<p>counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed<br>
that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from<br>
the raw count rates via the relation:</p>
<pre><code>                I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                    
</code></pre>
<p>where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and<br>
(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton<br>
values of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities<br>
for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption<br>
that some other mass species dominates, one must convert back<br>
to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then<br>
convert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the<br>
mass species in question.  The parameters can be found in<br>
Table 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,<br>
V. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons<br>
can be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,<br>
V. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,<br>
the count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,<br>
(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and<br>
(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.</p>
