 		"description": "AKEBONO (EXOS-D) is an aurora observation satellite launched by the M-3SII-4
   launch vehicle from Uchinoura Space Center (USC) on February 22, 1989. The objective
   of AKEBBONO is to investigate the magnetospheric phenomena associated with the
   acceleration process of
   aurora particles. Aurora is a luminous phenomenon that occurs when solar-wind particles
   trapped in the magnetosphere collide with Earth’s atmospheric particles. A better
   understanding of this phenomenon will help us understand the physical processes taking
   place in the Sun and the reaction on Earth. AKEBONO observes these physical processes to
   create a greater understanding of the structure of the magnetosphere and the flow and
   momentum of energy from the Sun through the geospace.  AKEBONO is an ambitious satellite
   carrying a number of "world-first" technologies. AKEBONO carries eight sets of instruments
   for scientific observation. It also has a radiation monitor, and anti-radiation technology
   that has been applied to a satellite for the first time in the world. This technology
   provides protection against radiation, even in the near-Earth radiation belt, as it is
   designed to tolerate about ten times the intensity withstood by conventional satellites.
   Other world-first technology applied to AKEBONO includes an extension mast for antenna and
   surface electrical conduction processing, to gain better conductivity and protection from
   charged particles. The GEOTAIL and NOZOMI satellites have inherited these technologies.
   GEOTAIL operates in the world-best quiet environment, which has never before been possible
   without the electromagnetic compatibility test conducted by AKEBONO.  The AKEBONO has
   operated for more than 20 years. Although the aurora imager camera has deteriorated due
   to the severe radioactive environment, all the other instruments are in good order. The
   direction of the major magnetic field of the Sun is known to reverse in a 22-year cycle.
   The Sun’s activeness, which is typically measured by the number of sunspots, increases and
   decreases twice in this 22-year cycle. In other words, the Sun’s behavior is changing in
   an 11-year cycle. To study the response of the magnetosphere to various activities of the
   Sun, we need to acquire data for 22 years. The AKEBONO will, therefore, continue its
   observations. [From: http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/akebono/index_e.html]",
